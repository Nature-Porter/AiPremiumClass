On this day, he is prompted to reflect deeply on his past, present, and future, particularly concerning his relationships and the choices he has made. The experiences he undergoes with the spirits during the night before Christmas Day profoundly impact him, leading to a heartfelt vow to honor the holiday and embrace its true spirit.\n\nAs a result of these transformative experiences, Scrooge undergoes a remarkable change on Christmas Day. He resolves to alter his life for the better, moving away from his previous miserly ways and embracing generosity, kindness, and the joy of the season.
