首至，击其中则首尾俱至。敢问兵可使如率然乎？曰可。夫吴人与越人相恶也，当其同舟而济而遇风，其相救也如左右手。是故方马埋轮，未足恃也；齐勇如一，政之道也；刚柔皆得，地之理也。故善用兵者，携手若使一人，不得已也。将军之事，静以幽，正以治，能愚士卒之耳目，使之无知；易其事，革其谋，使人无识；易其居，迂其途，使民不得虑。帅与之期，如登高而去其梯；帅与之深入诸侯之地，而发其机。若驱群羊，驱而往，驱而来，莫知所之。聚三军之众，投之于险，此谓将军之事也。  九地之变，屈伸之力，人情之理，不可不察也。  凡为客之道，深则专，浅则散。去国越境而师者，绝地也；四彻者，衢地也；入深者，重地也；入浅者，轻地也；背固前隘者，围地也；无所往者，死地也。是故散地吾将一其志，轻地吾将使之属，争地吾将趋其后，交地吾将谨其守，交地吾将固其结，衢地吾将谨其恃，重地吾将继其食，泛地吾将进其途，围地吾将塞其阙，死地吾将示之以不活。故兵之情：围则御，不得已则斗，过则从。  是故不知诸侯之谋者，不能预交；不知山林、险阻、沮泽之形者，不能行军；不用乡导，不能得地利。四五者，一不知，非霸王之兵也。夫霸王之兵，伐大国，则其众不得聚；威加于敌，则其交不得合。是故不争天下之交，不养天下之权，信己之私，威加于敌，则其城可拔，其国可隳。  施无法之赏，悬无政之令。犯三军之众，若使一人。犯之以事，勿告以言；犯之以害，勿告以利。投之亡地然后存，陷之死地然后生。夫众陷于害，然后能为胜败。故为兵之事，在顺详敌之意，并敌一向，千里杀将，是谓巧能成事。是故政举之日，夷关折符，无通其使，厉于廊庙之上，以诛其事。敌人开阖，必亟入之，先其所爱，微与之期，践墨随敌，以决战事。是故始如处女，敌人开户；后如脱兔，敌不及拒。  火攻第十二  孙子曰：凡火攻有五：一曰火人，二曰火积，三曰火辎，四曰火库，五曰火队。行火必有因，因必素具。发火有时，起火有日。时者，天之燥也。日者，月在箕、壁、翼、轸也。凡此四宿者，风起之日也。凡火攻，必因五火之变而应之：火发于内，则早应之于外；火发而其兵静者，待而勿攻，极其火力，可从而从之，不可从则上。火可发于外，无待于内，以时发之，火发上风，无攻下风，昼风久，夜风止。凡军必知五火之变，以数守之。
